# Recession Probability Modeling

Project developed in Python to determine probability of recession 6-12 months from now. Classification features used throughout the project include the 10 Year Tresury Yield - 3 Month T-Bill Yield, Consumer Sentiment Index, and Copper/Gold price ratio. A baseline logistic regression model was established and influenced by the New York Federal Reserve's widely followed recession probability model. The baseline logisitc regression model uses the 10 Year - 3 Month yield as its only feature. A suite of classification models - logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Naive Bayes - were tested and scored based on AUC. Naive Bayes outperformed all models with an AUC of 0.83. Please see below for the current chance of recession 6-12 months from now.
